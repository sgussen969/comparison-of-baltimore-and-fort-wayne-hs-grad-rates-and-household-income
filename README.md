Mini Project #1 that compares high school graduation rates for low-income and high-income students in Baltimore and Fort Wayne, as well as compares household income between Fort Wayne and Baltimore.

# Comparing High School Graduation Rates and Household Incomes for Students in Baltimore, Maryland, and Fort Wayne, Indiana

## Background

This project predominantly compares high school graduation rates for low and high-income students in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Baltimore, Maryland. It also compares household incomes for residents in the two cities. As a Fort Wayne who's a college student in Baltimore, I was curious to see how graduation rates compare, because both cities naturally have households of all socioeconomic statuses, but I assumed that, as a smaller and less diverse city, Fort Wayne would have higher graduation rates. However, I know certain areas of Fort Wayne face significant barriers to education, linked to SES, so thus chose high school graduation rates for lo and high-income students as a metric of comparison. I also chose to examine household income for both cities because SES is so influential in access to education and often ability to graduate. I was curious about the wealthiness of each city, and how this then impacts the graduation rates. In exploring this, I used open data sets from Opportunity Atlas [https://www.opportunityatlas.org.]

## Business Question

_**How does SES (in this case, household income is used as the metric) impact graduation rates of high school students in two different cities in America, and is the impact substantial enough that policy aimed at improving SES would thus directly result in higher graduation rates?**_

## Data Question - Open Data

I used data from https://www.opportunityatlas.org, specifically:
1. Household Income
  1. Fort Wayne, Indiana
  2. Baltimore, Maryland
2. High School Graduation Rate
  1. Fort Wayne, Indiana - Low Income, All genders, All races
  2. Baltimore, Maryland - Low Income, All genders, All races
  3. Fort Wayne, Indiana - High Income, All genders, All races
  4. Baltimore, Maryland - High Income, All genders, All races
All of these files can be found in the repo.

## Data Question - Analysis

I used Excel to compare:
- High school graduation rates for students of all income brackets in both cities
- Household income between Baltimore and Fort Wayne
- High school graduation rates for low-income students in Fort Wayne and Baltimore
- High school graduationrates for high-income students in Fort Wayne and Baltimore

I did not have full access to all of the various counties in Baltimore and Fort Wayne, which impacts data, but the rates for high school graduation across income brackets in the two cities were actually fairly similar. All income brackets in both cities had graduation rates 95 < x > 70, although Baltimore low-income students had slightly higher graduation rates than Fort Wayne students (0.73 - 0.87 versus 0.70 - 0.80). For high-income students, the rates were very very similar, but two counties in Baltimore had rates of 0.94 and 0.95, while the highest graduation rate for a county in Fort Wayne was 0.93.

Furthermore, Fort Wayne is not as wealthy as Baltimore, according to my analysis. Although there were households in every income bracket from the data set, Fort Wayne's data skewed left (towards lower incomes) while Baltimore's data skewed right (towards higher incomes). More data is needed to conduct further, more in-depth research, because household income does play a huge role in a student's ability to attend high school, do well, stay in school, and graduate. So the results were surprising, but could be attributed to human error as well as lack of enough data.
